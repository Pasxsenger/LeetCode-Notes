# LeetCode-Notes
This is a repository of LeetCode notes by a former old rookie ACM-ICPC participant who is now relearning algorithms as a toddler.

When I wrote down these notes, I think it's kind of verbose sometimes. But from another perspective, perhaps that's how progress is made.



**Algorithms:**

* [Tow Pointers](https://github.com/Pasxsenger/LeetCode-Notes/blob/main/Two%20Pointers.md)
* [Sorting](https://github.com/Pasxsenger/LeetCode-Notes/blob/main/Sorting.md)
* [Greedy](https://github.com/Pasxsenger/LeetCode-Notes/blob/main/Greedy.md)
* [Binary Search](https://github.com/Pasxsenger/LeetCode-Notes/blob/main/Binary%20Search.md)
* [Divide and Conquer](https://github.com/Pasxsenger/LeetCode-Notes/blob/main/Divide%20and%20Conquer.md)
* [BFS](https://github.com/Pasxsenger/LeetCode-Notes/blob/main/BFS.md)
