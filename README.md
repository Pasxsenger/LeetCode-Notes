# LeetCode-Notes
This is some notes for things I learned by comparing my solutions to other solutions.

When I wrote down these notes, I think it's verbose sometimes. But from another perspective, perhaps that's how progress is made.

Thank you [CyC2018](https://github.com/CyC2018/CS-Notes/blob/master/notes/Leetcode%20%E9%A2%98%E8%A7%A3%20-%20%E7%9B%AE%E5%BD%95.md) for your brilliant notes!
